The estimated duration was accurate, and the waterfall was more impressive than I expected. The only thing I'd suggest is bringing extra water during summer months - it gets hot!"</p>

The Donut Falls hike recommendation was perfect for beginners! The directions were clear, and the website's estimate of a 1-hour hike was right on target. The waterfall flowing through the donut-shaped hole was so unique!"</p>

The Lower Calf Creek Falls trail was my favorite - the emerald pool at the base of the waterfall was like something out of a fantasy novel. The accuracy of the trail information helped me prepare perfectly for the day."</p>
